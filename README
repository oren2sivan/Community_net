important directories for the project:
1- client
2- server
3- config


note: the code is working and the networks run well. *but*, i still have to finish the communication of the server and client when uploading a file to the network.
uploading files is possible but, i need tpo make it easier for the users to know whcih files are available for them...




YOU CAN FIND A .EXE FILE TO RUN THE PROJECT AT dist  DIRECTORY
by the way, before running the .exe, you should first download all the server directory and  run the server_log_in.py file
